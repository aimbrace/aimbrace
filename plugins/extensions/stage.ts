/**
 * Staging: every installed version of an extension is a complete copy under `<home>/extensions-staged/<name>/<stamp>-<hash>/`.
 *
 * Extracted from ACRYL (`acryl-extension-context/lib/stage.js`). Node caches an ES module by URL, so a re-imported file keeps its old
 * code; a copy at a new path has fresh URLs for the entry and everything it imports, so it is evaluated anew. The author's source folder
 * is never modified. The hash makes an unchanged source recognisable; the stamp makes "newest" well defined.
